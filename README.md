## Project Files

CS50 Flask Blog is built by utilising Flask Blueprints to make the application scalable and easy to maintain. The application files are stored in the main app folder `blog/`.

The root folder of CS50 Flask Blog contains `requirements.txt`, a list of dependency packages of the project.

The `blog/` folder contains the following Python files for the Flask application:
- `__init__.py`: For initialising the application, include Flask Blueprints for `auth`, `blogging` and `account`
- `helpers.py`: For [helper functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-helper-functions/) that are used across the whole project, including setting certain pages as visible only if the user has logged in, and displaying apology messages
- `auth.py`: For creating and logging in user account
- `blogging.py`: For creating, editing, deleting and displaying blog posts
- `account.py`: For changing username and password
- `info.py`: For information about CS50 Flask Blog

In addition, the `blog/` folder contins the following subfolders:
- `database/`: Includes the `blog.db` SQL database file used for the entire application, storing data for user account and blog posts
- `static/`: For static files for the project, including CSS, favicon and asset files
- `templates/`: Page templates for the application, divided for different components:
    - `layout.html`: Base layout for the entire application, including the navigation bar (`_navbar.html`) and footer (`_footer.html`) components
    - `apology.html`: Page for displaying apology messages
    - `auth/` subfolder: Pages for user account registration (`register.html`) and user log-in (`login.html`).
    - `blogging/` subfolder: Pages for the home page (`index.html`), blog post creation (`create.html`), blog post editing and deletion (`edit.html`) and displaying posts (`_postlist.html`)
    - `account/` subfolder: Page for changing username and password (`account.html`)
